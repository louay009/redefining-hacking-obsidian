← Back to [[Red Team Engagements]]

## 📖 Definition
Realistic end-to-end attack scenarios mimicking specific threat actors.

## 🔧 Characteristics
- **🔄 Full Attack Lifecycle**: Reconnaissance → multiple outcomes
- **🌍 Real-world Conditions**: Actual attack environment simulation
- **📋 Specific Use Cases**: APT simulations, supply chain attacks, ransomware
- **⏰ Duration**: Weeks to months timeline
- **🧠 Threat Intelligence-driven**: Based on real threat actor intelligence

## ✅ Benefits
- **🌐 Comprehensive Threat Emulation**: Holistic view through full attack lifecycle
- **🌍 Real-World Relevance**: Current/emerging threats with active threat actor TTPs
- **🏢 Industry-Specific Risks**: Threats relevant to specific industry sectors

## ❌ Drawbacks
- **🌊 Broad Scope**: Wide focus may dilute attention, missing critical vulnerabilities
- **📊 Difficult Outcome Measurement**: Multiple outcomes complicate success metrics
- **🔧 Complexity Management**: Requires sophisticated planning and execution
